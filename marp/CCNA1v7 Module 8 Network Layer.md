# Network Layer

# Network Layer
- Provides services to allow end devices to exchange data.
- Network Layer Protocols: **IPv4 and IPv6**.
- The network layer performs four **basic operations**:
  - üì´ **Addressing end devices**
  - üì• **Encapsulation**
  - üöó **Routing**
  - üì§ **De-encapsulation**
- ü§î **The IP addressing does not change from source to destination.**

---

# Network Layer Characteristics

IP have low overhead and may be described as:
  - **Connectionless**: does not establish a connection before sending a packet. There is no control information needed.
  - **Best effort**: will not guarantee delivery of the packet. Reduced overhead and no acknowledments.
  - **Media Independent**:
    - IP is unreliable: cannot manage or fix undelivered or corrupt packets
    - IP is media independent: can be sent over any media type.

Layer 3 splits the IPv4 into smaller units (Fragmentation, **MTU**: Maximum Transport Unit)

# IPv6 Overview

**IPv4 has 3 major limitations:**
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **IPv4 address depletion:** run out of IPv4 addressing
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Lack of end-to-end connectivity:** private addressing and NAT were created
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Increased network complexity:** NAT was a temporary solution, create issues and causes latency.

**IPv6 overcomes the limitation of IPv4:**
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Increased address space:** based on 128 bit address instead of 32 bit
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Improved packet handling:** simplified header with fewer fields
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Eliminates the need for NAT:** no need to use private addressing internally

# Host Forwarding Decision

- Each host devices creates their own routing table.
- A host can send packets to:
  - **Itself**: 127.0.0.1 (IPv4), ::1 (IPv6)
  - **Local hosts**: destination on the same LAN. Traffic handled by intermediary device.
  - **Remote hosts**: devices are not on the same LAN. Traffic forwarded directly to LAN default gateway.
- The source device determines whether the destination is local or remote:
  - **IPv4:** Source IP address and network mask <> Destination IP address
  - **IPv6:** Source uses the network address and prefix advertised by local router

---

# Default Gateway

**A Router or Layer 3 Switch can be a default gateway.**
- It must have an IP address in the same range as the rest of the LAN.
- It can route to other networks.

**A default gateway is static route which will be a last resort route in the routing table.**
**All device on the LAN will need the default gateway of the router if they intend to send traffic remotely. If a device has no default gateway or a bad default gateway, its traffic will not be able to leave the LAN.**

Host will know the default gateway:
- IPv4: statically or through DHCP
- IPv6: through RS (Router Solicitation) or manually

Display the PC routing table:
- Windows: ```route print``` or ```netstat -r```
- Linux: ```ip route```

# Router Packet Forwarding Decision

What happens when the router receives the frame from the host device?

# IP Routing Table

3 types of routes in a router's routing table:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Directly Connected:** These routes are automatically added by the router, provided the interface is active and has addressing.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Remote:** These are the routes the router does not have a direct connection and may be learned:
  - Manually ‚Äì with a static route
  - Dynamically ‚Äì by using a routing protocol to have the routers share their information with each other
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Default Route:** this forwards all traffic to a specific direction when there is not a match in the routing table
