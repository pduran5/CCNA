# Address Resolution

<!-- _footer: "üìï CCNA1v7 Module 9 Address Resolution\nüßëüèª‚Äçüè´ Pedro Dur√°n" -->

# MAC and IP. Destination on Same Network

There are 2 primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN:
- üí™üèº **Layer 2 physical address (the MAC address):** Used for NIC to NIC communications on the same Ethernet network.
- ü§ñ **Layer 3 logical address (the IP address):** Used to send the packet from the source device to the destination device. 

## Same network
 - Layer 2 addresses are used to deliver frames from one NIC to another NIC.
 - If a destination IP address is on the same network, the destination MAC address will be that of the destination device.

---

# MAC and IP. Destination on Remote Network

- When the destination IP address is on a remote network, **the destination MAC address is that of the default gateway**.

:warning: **ARP (IPv4) or ICMPv6 (IPv6) is used to associate the IP address of a device with the MAC address of the device NIC.**

A device uses ARP to determine the destination MAC address of a local device when it knows its IPv4 address.

**ARP provides 2 basic functions:**
  - :one: Resolving IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses
  - :two: Maintaining an ARP table of IPv4 to MAC address mappings

# ARP Functions

To send a frame, a device will search its **ARP table for a destination IPv4 address and a corresponding MAC address**.
 - ü§î **Destination IP address on the same network?** ‚û°Ô∏è device will search the ARP table for the **destination IP address**.
 - ü§î **Destination IPv4 address on a different network?** ‚û°Ô∏è device will search the ARP table for the **IP address of the default gateway**.

ü§î **Device locates the IP address?** ‚û°Ô∏è its corresponding MAC address is used as the destination MAC address in the frame. 
ü§î **There is no ARP table entry found?** ‚û°Ô∏è Device sends an **ARP request**.

# Removing Entries from an ARP Table

Entries in the ARP table are not permanent and **are removed when an ARP cache timer expires after a specified period of time**. The duration of the ARP cache timer differs depending on the operating system.

- ü™ü Windows:
  - Show ARP Table ‚û°Ô∏è ```arp -a```
  - Remove ARP Table ‚û°Ô∏è ```arp -d```
- üêß Linux:
  - Show ARP Table ‚û°Ô∏è ```ip neigh```
  - Remove ARP Table ‚û°Ô∏è ```sudo ip neigh flush all```
- ü¶ú Cisco:
  - Show ARP Table ‚û°Ô∏è ```show ip arp```
  - Remove ARP Table ‚û°Ô∏è ```clear ip arp```

# <!--fit-->ARP Issues ‚Äì ARP Broadcasting and ARP Spoofing

ARP requests are received and processed **by every device on the local network.**
 - ‚õàÔ∏è Excessive ARP broadcasts can cause some **reduction in performance**.
 - ü§° **ARP replies can be spoofed** by a threat actor to perform an ARP poisoning attack. Enterprise level switches include mitigation techniques to protect against ARP attacks (DAI: Dynamic ARP Inspection).

# IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Messages

IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol provides:
- **Address resolution:** ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) 
- **Router discovery:** ICMPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA) 
- **Redirection services:** ICMPv6 redirect messages

**ICMPv6 devices use ND to resolve the MAC address of a known IPv6 address.**

ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages are sent using special Ethernet and IPv6 multicast addresses.
